Themes
As part of our mission to accelerate real-world blockchain adoption, this hackathon is designed to push the boundaries of innovation in three high-impact categories: Payments, Telegram Mini Apps, and AI-Powered DApps. Participants will have the opportunity to build cutting-edge solutions using Hathor’s Nano Contracts, the newly launched EVM Bridge, and its feeless, scalable blockchain infrastructure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Telegram Mini Apps – The Next Frontier in Web3 Adoption
Challenge: Build engaging and functional Telegram Mini Apps that integrate Hathor’s Nano Contracts to onboard millions of users into Web3.

Opportunities:
✅ Token-based communities – Enable frictionless P2P payments, tipping, and tokenized membership systems.


Why it matters: Telegram is one of the fastest-growing Web3 platforms, with over 800M active users. This challenge is about harnessing this momentum to build Web3-native experiences that are accessible, engaging, and instantly deployable.
